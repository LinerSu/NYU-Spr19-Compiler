## Tool Used
As course requirement, it will used a language - HACS for constructing compilers. Please find these links ([Intro](https://www.twosigma.com/insights/article/technical-report-introduction-to-compiler-generation-using-hacs/) and [Git](https://github.com/crsx/hacs)) for more details about HACS.

This project is divided by three parts:
  - *Lexer and Parser* for programming language MiniC
